GStreamer 1.x Java Swing (gst1-java-fx)
========================================

This is the OpenJFX integration for [gst1-java-core][gst1-java-core], a set of Java
bindings for [GStreamer 1.x][gstreamer].

## Status and support

Releases are available via Maven Central (under the `org.freedesktop.gstreamer`
group ID), or can be downloaded from GitHub.

The current lead maintainer of the bindings is Neil C Smith at
[Codelerity Ltd][codelerity]. The bindings are a fork of the original
GStreamer-Java bindings for GStreamer 0.10 started by Wayne Meissner. Numerous
other people have made valuable contributions to the original project and the 1.x
fork over the years.

Initial help on getting started, and support for open-source projects, can be obtained
from the [GStreamer-Java Google Group][gstreamer-java-group].

Commercial support is available, and sponsorship of additional features is welcome -
please email info@codelerity.com to discuss.
